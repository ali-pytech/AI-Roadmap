#  Day 17 — Functions in Python

Today I learned how to create and use **functions** in Python. Functions are reusable blocks of code that make projects cleaner, modular, and professional. Instead of repeating the same logic, I can define it once and call it whenever I need. This feels like a big step toward building real applications.



##  Projects I Built

### Iqama Fee Calculator
I created a function that calculates iqama fees based on the year. If the year is 2026 or later, it adds a 10% increase. This makes my iqama system flexible and reusable.

###  VAT Calculator Function
I built a function that calculates totals with VAT. It even has a default VAT rate of 15%, which makes it easy to reuse for different products without rewriting the formula.

###  Housing Annual Rent Function
I wrote a function that converts monthly rent into annual rent. This is simple but powerful, and it can be reused for any apartment record.

###  Student Grade Function
I created a function that evaluates student grades and returns statuses like “Excellent,” “Good,” or “Needs Improvement.” This feels like a real evaluation system.

###  Shopping Cart Function
I built a function that calculates the subtotal for each product in a shopping cart. This looks like the foundation of a checkout system.



##  Reflections
- Functions make my code **modular and reusable**.  
- Parameters and return values give flexibility to handle different inputs.  
- Default parameters save time and make functions smarter.  
- My projects today looked like **calculators, evaluators, and reusable tools**.  
- I feel like I’m writing code the way professionals do — organized and clean.
