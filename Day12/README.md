# Day 12 — Dictionaries and Nested Data

Today felt like another big leap forward. Yesterday I learned how to handle multiple values with lists, but today I discovered how to give those values **structure** using dictionaries. Instead of just storing numbers or strings, I can now store key‑value pairs that make my programs look more like real applications. It felt like I was moving closer to building proper systems.



##  Projects I Built

###  Iqama Renewal Dictionary
I created a program that stores iqama holders with their renewal years and fees in a dictionary. Each person is a key, and their renewal details are the value. It feels more organized than just lists.

###  VAT Invoice Dictionary
This project stores items and their prices in a dictionary, then applies 15% VAT to each. It looks like a mini invoice system, where each item has a name and a calculated total.

###  Housing Rent Dictionary
Here I stored apartment names as keys and their monthly rents as values. The program converts each rent into annual rent and prints results. It feels like a basic property record system.

##  Extra Challenges I Tried

###  Student Grades Dictionary
I built a dictionary where student names are keys and their grades are values. The program calculates the average grade and shows who scored highest.

###  Word Frequency Counter
This challenge takes a sentence, splits it into words, and counts how many times each word appears using a dictionary. It made me realize how powerful dictionaries are for text analysis.



##  Reflections
- Dictionaries make data feel **structured and meaningful**.  
- I practiced accessing values by keys, updating records, and looping through dictionaries.  
- Nested dictionaries opened the door to storing more complex records (like multiple details for each student or apartment).  
- Compared to lists, dictionaries feel closer to **real applications** because they connect names to values.
