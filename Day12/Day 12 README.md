# Day 12 — Dictionaries and Nested Data

Today I stepped into a new level of Python: **dictionaries**. Unlike lists, which just store values, dictionaries let me connect names to values, making my projects feel more like real applications. I also explored **nested dictionaries**, which allow me to store multiple details for each record. This felt like building mini databases.


##  Projects I Built

###  Iqama Renewal Dictionary
I created a program that stores iqama holders with their renewal year and fee in a dictionary. Each person is a key, and their renewal details are stored as values. It looks much more organized than lists.

###  VAT Invoice Dictionary
This project stores items and their prices in a dictionary, then applies 15% VAT to each. It prints both the original price and the VAT‑added total, like a mini invoice system.

###  Housing Rent Dictionary
Here I stored apartment names as keys and their monthly rents as values. The program converts each rent into annual rent and prints results. It feels like a basic property record system.



##  Extra Challenges I Tried

###  Student Grades Dictionary
I built a dictionary where student names are keys and their grades are values. The program calculates the average grade and shows who scored highest. This made me practice looping through dictionaries and using built‑in functions like `max()`.

###  Word Frequency Counter 
This challenge takes a sentence, splits it into words, and counts how many times each word appears using a dictionary.  
I then improved it by **sorting the output by frequency**, so the most common words appear first. This made the program look more professional and useful for text analysis.



##  Reflections
- Dictionaries make data feel **structured and meaningful**.  
- I practiced accessing values by keys, updating records, and looping through dictionaries.  
- Nested dictionaries opened the door to storing more complex records (like multiple details for each student or apartment).  
- The sorted word frequency counter showed me how to combine dictionaries with sorting logic to produce cleaner, recruiter‑ready results.  
- Compared to lists, dictionaries feel closer to **real applications** because they connect names to values.
