#  Day 10 — Functions, and String Practice

Today I focused on:
- Writing modular Python functions
- Using `if __name__ == "__main__":` for clean structure
- Handling user input with `try/except`
- Documenting my journey in GitHub

## Projects Completed

### 1. Iqama Renewal Calculator (`iqama.py`)
- Calculates total iqama renewal fee based on years.
- Includes error handling for non-numeric input.

### 2. VAT Calculator (`vat.py`)
- Applies 15% VAT to item price.
- Returns both VAT amount and total price.

### 3. Housing Rent Calculator (`housing.py`)
- Converts monthly rent into annual rent.
- Simple function with user input validation.

## Extra Challenges

### 1. Multiplication of Digits (`Multiplication_of_digits.py`)
- Function `mul_of_digits(num)` multiplies all digits of a number.
- Example: `123 → 1 * 2 * 3 = 6`
- Includes error handling for invalid input.

### 2. Reverse String Challenge (`reverse_string.py`)
- Function `reverse_string(text)` reverses any string using slicing (`[::-1]`).
- Example: `"Ali" → "ilA"`
- Includes input handling and clean output formatting.

## Reflection
Day 9 was about learning functions. Day 10 feels different because now my work is visible.  
I reinforced functions with user inputs, learned a new trick with string manipulation, and most importantly, started my GitHub diary. This makes the journey feel real and professional.
