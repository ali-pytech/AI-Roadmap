# Day 10 — Functions, GitHub Setup, and String Practice

Today was a big step forward. I didn’t just write code — I also set up my GitHub repository to start documenting this 60‑day journey publicly.

## What I Built
- **Iqama Renewal Assistant**  
  Wrote a function `iqama_fee_cal(years)` that takes user input and calculates the renewal fee.

- **Zakat & VAT Compliance Advisor**  
  Created a function `vat_cal(price)` to handle VAT for a single item price entered by the user.

- **Riyadh Smart Housing Finder**  
  Added a function `annual_rent(monthly_rent)` to calculate yearly rent from monthly input.

- **String Reverser (new challenge)**  
  Tried out string slicing with a function `reverse_string(text)` that flips any user‑entered string.  
  Example: typing `Ali` returns `ilA`.

## GitHub Milestone
- Created my first public repo: **Ali-60Day-AI-Roadmap**  
- Added a `Day10` folder with code and reflections  
- Made my first commit and pushed it successfully  

## Reflection
Day 9 was about learning functions. Day 10 feels different because now my work is **visible**.  
I reinforced functions with user inputs, learned a new trick with string manipulation, and most importantly, started my GitHub diary. This makes the journey feel real and professional.
