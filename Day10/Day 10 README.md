#Day 10 — Functions, GitHub Setup, and Extra Challenges

Day 10 felt special. For the first time, I can actually see my code living inside GitHub — not just random files on my laptop, but a proper repo that tells my story. It feels like I’m building something real, step by step.  

Today I worked with functions, practiced error handling, and added some fun challenges to push myself further. Writing code by hand in VS Code and then committing it here makes me feel like I’m slowly becoming the engineer I want to be.


##  Projects I Built

###  Iqama Renewal Calculator (`iqama.py`)
A simple program that calculates iqama renewal fees based on the number of years. It asks for input, multiplies by the fixed fee, and shows the total. I added error handling so it doesn’t crash if someone types letters instead of numbers. It feels practical, like something people could actually use.

###  VAT Calculator (`vat.py`)
This one applies the 15% VAT rate to any item price. It prints both the VAT amount and the final total. It’s straightforward, but it connects directly to real life in Saudi Arabia, which makes it meaningful for me.

###  Housing Rent Calculator (`housing.py`)
Takes monthly rent and converts it into annual rent. Another small but useful program, with input validation included. It’s simple, but it made me think about how everyday problems can be solved with just a few lines of Python.

##  Extra Challenges I Tried

###  Multiplication of Digits (`mul_of_digits.py`)
I wanted to go beyond the roadmap, so I wrote a function that multiplies all the digits of a number.  
Example: `123 → 1 * 2 * 3 = 6`.  
It was fun to figure out how to turn a number into a string and loop through each digit. It reminded me that even small problems can teach big lessons.

###  Reverse String (`reverse_string.py`)
Another challenge I added: reversing any string using Python slicing (`[::-1]`).  
Example: `"Ali" → "ilA"`.  
It’s simple, but I enjoyed it because it shows how powerful and elegant Python can be. Sometimes the shortest solutions are the most satisfying.

##  Reflections
- I’m starting to feel more confident writing code directly in VS Code and then committing it to GitHub.  
- The `__main__` guard makes my files look cleaner and more professional.  
- Error handling is becoming second nature — I don’t want my programs to break on bad input.  
- Adding extra challenges (like digit multiplication and reverse string) made me feel like I’m exploring on my own, not just following instructions. That’s a big win for me today.
