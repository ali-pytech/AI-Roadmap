#  Day 16 — Sets and Unique Data Handling

Today I explored **sets in Python**, which are collections that automatically remove duplicates and allow powerful operations like union, intersection, and difference. Sets feel different from lists and dictionaries because they focus on uniqueness. This makes them perfect for handling data where repetition doesn’t make sense, like customer lists, attendance records, or housing filters.



##  Projects I Built

###  Iqama Unique Years
I created a set of iqama renewal years. Even though I added duplicates, the set kept only unique values. This showed me how sets can clean data automatically.

###  VAT Customers Union
I combined two sets of customers from January and February using union (`|`). The result was a complete list of all customers across both months. This feels like merging records in a business system.

###  Housing Intersection
I used intersection (`&`) to find apartments that were both in Riyadh and affordable. This mimics a smart housing filter that shows only the options meeting multiple conditions.

### Student Difference
I compared registered students with those who attended. Using difference (`-`), I identified the absent students. This looks like an attendance tracking system.

### Shopping Cart Membership
I checked if “Shoes” were in the cart using membership (`in`). This is a simple but powerful way to verify product presence in a shopping system.



## Reflections
- Sets automatically remove duplicates, which makes data cleaner.  
- Union, intersection, and difference are powerful for combining and filtering records.  
- Membership checks are simple but essential for verifying data.  
- My projects today looked like **customer trackers, housing filters, and attendance systems**.  
- I feel like I’m learning how to manage **unique values** in real applications, which is critical for professional systems.
