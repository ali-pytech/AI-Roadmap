# Day 15 — Loops and Advanced Iteration with Dictionaries

Today I learned how to use **loops with dictionaries** to filter, summarize, and display data in smarter ways. This was a big step because now my systems don’t just store information — they can process it, analyze it, and give meaningful results. It feels like I’m building intelligent applications.



## Projects I Built

###  Iqama Renewal Filter
I looped through iqama records and printed only those with an "Expired" status. This made my system behave like a government filter that shows only the cases needing attention.

###  VAT Invoice Totals
I calculated totals for each product and then added them into a grand total. This looked like a real invoice system that prints both item totals and the final bill.

###  Housing Filter by Rent
I filtered apartments with rent below 2500 SAR. This mimics a smart housing finder that helps people quickly see affordable options.

###  Student Grade Summary
I looped through student records, added all grades, and calculated the average. This feels like a university system that summarizes performance.

###  Shopping Cart Detailed Output
I printed each product in the cart with quantity, price, and subtotal. The output looked like a professional checkout receipt.



##  Reflections
- Loops make dictionaries **powerful and dynamic**.  
- I can now filter records, calculate totals, and summarize data.  
- My projects look like **real systems**: government filters, invoices, housing finders, and receipts.  
- This feels like the foundation of **intelligent applications** that recruiters will recognize.  
- I’m proud because my code is no longer just static — it’s interactive and useful.
