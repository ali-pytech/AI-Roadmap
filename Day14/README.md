# Day 14 — Dictionary Methods and Advanced Operations

Today I learned how to **manipulate dictionaries** using built-in methods. This was a big step forward because now my systems aren’t just storing data — they can update, delete, check, and reset records dynamically. It feels like I’m managing real databases, not just static examples.


## Projects I Built

###  Iqama Renewal Update
I practiced updating existing records with `.update()` and adding new entries. This made my iqama system flexible, just like a government database that changes over time.

###  VAT Invoice Delete
I used `del` to remove a product from the invoice. This showed me how to clean up data when items are no longer needed.

###  Housing Safe Access
I used `.get()` to safely access records. If an apartment doesn’t exist, the program returns “Not Found” instead of crashing. This is important for real systems where missing data is common.

###  Student Records Check
I used `"key" in dict` to check if a student exists before accessing their details. This prevents errors and makes the system more reliable.

###  Shopping Cart Copy & Clear
I learned how to duplicate a dictionary with `.copy()` and reset it with `.clear()`. This feels like creating backups and refreshing systems — very practical for real applications.


##  Reflections
- Dictionary methods make my projects **dynamic and professional**.  
- I can now **update, delete, check, copy, and clear** records easily.  
- Safe access (`.get()`) and existence checks are essential for building **error-free systems**.  
- These skills bring me closer to handling **real-world databases and applications**.  
- I feel more confident because my code now looks like something that could actually run in a business or government system.
