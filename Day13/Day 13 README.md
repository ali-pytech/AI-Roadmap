# Day 13 — Nested Dictionaries and Advanced Features

Today I leveled up my Python skills by working with **nested dictionaries**. Unlike simple dictionaries, nested ones allow me to store multiple attributes for each record. This feels like building mini databases, where every entry has structured details. My projects now look closer to real systems used in government, business, and housing.

## Projects I Built

###  Iqama Renewal System
I created a dictionary where each person’s iqama record includes **year, fee, and status**. This mimics a government database, showing whether an iqama is active, pending, or expired.

###  VAT Invoice with Item Details
I built a system where each product stores **price and quantity**. The program calculates totals with VAT applied, producing results like a real invoice system.

###  Housing Records
I designed a housing dictionary where each apartment has **monthly rent, location, and size**. The program converts monthly rent into annual rent and prints structured housing details, just like a real estate listing.



##  Extra Challenges

###  University Student Records
I stored student names with **age, grade, and major**. This looks like a university database system, where each record contains multiple attributes.

###  Shopping Cart System
I created a shopping cart where each product has **price, quantity, and discount**. The program calculates subtotal, discount, and final total, mimicking a checkout system.



##  Reflections
- Nested dictionaries make data feel **structured and realistic**, like actual databases.  
- I practiced accessing multiple attributes, updating values, and looping through complex records.  
- Adding attributes like **status, location, and discount** made my projects look professional.  
- These systems now resemble **government records, invoices, housing listings, and shopping carts**.  
- I feel like I’m building the foundation of **real-world applications**..
