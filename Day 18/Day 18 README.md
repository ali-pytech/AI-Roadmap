#  Day 18 — Error Handling in Python

Today I learned how to use **error handling** in Python with `try` and `except`. This makes my systems more reliable because they don’t crash when something goes wrong. Instead, they show clear messages and continue running.



##  Projects I Built

###  Iqama Input Validation
I caught invalid inputs when entering iqama fees. This prevents crashes and guides the user.

###  VAT Division Error
I handled division by zero when calculating VAT per item. The program now shows a clear message instead of breaking.

###  Housing File Handling
I managed missing file errors when reading housing data. This is important for real systems where files may not exist.

###  Student Grade Input
I validated student score inputs to ensure only numbers are accepted. This makes the system more user‑friendly.

###  Shopping Cart Cleanup
I handled missing items in the cart and used `finally` to always run cleanup code. This feels like a professional checkout system.



##  Reflections
- Error handling makes my code **robust and user‑friendly**.  
- I can now catch mistakes like invalid input, missing files, and division by zero.  
- `finally` ensures cleanup always happens, which is important for reliability.  
- My projects today looked like **real systems that guide users instead of crashing**.  
- I feel more confident because my applications now handle problems gracefully.
