# Day 11 — Lists with User Input

Today felt like a real step forward. Up until now, most of my programs only worked with one value at a time. But life isn’t like that — we deal with many things at once. So learning how to use **lists** made my code feel more alive. Suddenly, I can collect multiple inputs, store them, and process them together. It’s like my programs grew up a little today.



##  Projects I Built

###  Iqama Renewal List
I asked the user to enter several iqama renewal years, stored them in a list, and calculated the fee for each. It felt like I was scaling up my Day 10 project into something more flexible and practical.

###  VAT on Multiple Items
Instead of just one item, this program takes a list of prices, applies 15% VAT to each, and prints the totals. It reminded me of how invoices work in real life — multiple items, one calculation system.

###  Housing Rent List
This one takes monthly rents for different apartments, converts each into annual rent, and prints the results. It’s simple, but it shows how lists can handle multiple records at once, just like a real housing comparison.



##  Extra Challenges I Tried

###  Average of Numbers
I wrote a function that calculates the average of a list of numbers. It was a good reminder of how useful `sum()` and `len()` can be together.

###  Maximum Number Finder
Another challenge: finding the largest number in a list. Python’s built‑in `max()` made it easy, but I liked how clean and powerful the solution looked.



##  Reflections
 -Lists make programs feel more realistic — they can handle multiple values instead of just one.  
 -I practiced splitting user input into lists and looping through them.  
 -Error handling is still important; one wrong input can break everything.  
-Adding two challenges every day makes me feel like I’m exploring beyond the roadmap, not just following instructions.
